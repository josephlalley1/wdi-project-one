# Project 1: SNAKE

### Overview

SNAKE is an interactive experience where a user plays using arrow keys in order to manoeuvre the Snake into devouring the apples, which make the Snake grow and increase in speed (making the difficulty increase also). The website also features a Whack-A-Mole side game.

### Project Brief

- Render a grid-based game in the browser
- Switch turns between two players
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, using Github Pages, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### Challenges and Problems

- A big challenge was using JavaScript DOM manipulation to make it look like I had a front page, but everything was just on one page, and required no page switches.

---

### Wins

- Timing the transitions that were used for the new pages to bounce in and the old page to bounce out was a big win for myself, as it took a little bit of tinkering to find the correct time and finding the correct way to implement the time interval delay to render the new DOM element.

### Future Features

Features I would have liked to include:

- I would like to add more games to the arcade, including various old classic games (Mario type games and other retro games).

- I would love to look into 3d JavaScript frameworks and engines, in order to create a 3d arcade where the user could walk around the arcade and choose what game they would like to play.
